	<h2>The dmcs Solver</h2>
	
	<p>
	  <b>dmcs</b> is the name of a prototypical implementation of a fully distributed algorithm to evaluate Multi-Context Systems. 
	<br/>

      <h2>What are Multi-Context Systems ?</h2>
      
      
	<p>
	  Multi-Context Systems (MCS) are formalisms that enable the
	  interlinkage of single knowledge bases, called contexts, via
	  bridge rules, which allow to add knowledge to a context
	  depending on knowledge in other contexts. For instance, the
	  bridge rule <em>a :- (2:b)</em> of a
	  context <em>C1</em> means that <em>C1</em> should
	  conclude <em>a</em> if context <em>C2</em>
	  believes <em>b</em>. On the other hand, each context has a
	  <em>local knowledge base</em> based on some logic. This
	  makes MCS generic for distributed knowledge based
	  representation problem.
	</p>
	<p>
	  MCS have applications in various areas, such as
	  argumentation, data integration, or multi-agent systems.
	  There, each context may model the beliefs of an agent while
	  the bridge rules model an agent's perception of the
	  environment, i.e., other contexts.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <b>The <em>&ldquo;Scientists Example&rdquo;</em> gives a
	  concrete scenario for MCS</b>: a group of four scientists,
	  <em>Ms.1</em>, <em>Mr.2</em>, <em>Mr.3</em>,
	  and <em>Ms.4</em>, just finished their conference visit and
	  are now arranging a trip back home. They can choose between
	  going by train or by car (which is usually slower than the
	  train); and if they use the train, they should bring along
	  some food. Moreover, <em>Mr.3</em> and <em>Ms.4</em> have
	  additional information from home that might affect their
	  decision.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <em>Mr.3</em> has a daughter, <em>Ms.6</em>. He is fine with
	  either transportation option, but if <em>Ms.6</em> is sick
	  then he wants to use the fastest vehicle to get
	  home. <em>Ms.4</em> just got married, and her
	  husband, <em>Mr.5</em>, wants her to come back as soon as
	  possible. He urges her to to try to come home even sooner,
	  while <em>Ms.4</em> tries to yield to her husband's plea.
	</p>

	<p>
	  If they go by train, <em>Mr.3</em> is responsible for buying
	  provisions. He might choose either sandwiches or chocolate
	  peanuts. The options for beverages are coke or juice.
	  <em>Mr.2</em> is a modest person as long as he gets home. He
	  agrees to any choice that <em>Mr.3</em> and <em>Ms.4</em>
	  select for vehicle but he dislikes coke. <em>Ms.1</em> is
	  the leader of the group and prefers to go by car, but
	  if <em>Mr.2</em> and <em>3</em> want to go by train then she
	  would not object. The only problem is that <em>Ms.1</em> is
	  allergic to peanuts.
	</p>

	<p>
	  <em>Mr.3</em> and <em>Ms.4</em> do not want to bother the
	  others with their personal situation and communicate just
	  their preferences, which is sufficient for reaching an
	  agreement. Ultimately, <em>Ms.1</em> decides which option to
	  take based on the information she gets from <em>Mr.2</em> and
	  <em>Mr.3</em>.
	</p>
 
	<p>
	  There are three agreements for this scenario, in one of
	  those, the group goes by train, brings juice and sandwiches
	  along, while <em>Mr.5</em> is urging his wife to come home
	  and <em>Ms.6</em> is sick.
